            <br/>
            <Typography>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.</Typography>
            <br/>

            <br/>
            <Typography>Our Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals:</Typography>
            <br/>
            <Typography>We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked.</Typography>
            <br/>
            <Typography>You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.</Typography>

            <Typography>12. <b>Your Data Protection Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</b></Typography>
